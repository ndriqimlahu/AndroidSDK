<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project called `Android SDK` is an package project where Android Software Development is the process by which applications are created for devices running the Android operating system, where these applications are written by programming languages such as Java and Kotlin which use the Android Software Development Kit (SDK). Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in an installable package. Android SDK is a software development kit which is developed by Google for the Android platform. The Android SDK provides the API library and developer tools needed to build, test, and debug applications for the Android mobile operating system. In this project you can navigate into two types which are “Project_Documentation” and “Project_Presentation”.
